Nano-U is a tiny encoder-decoder segmentation network built for autonomous navigation on commodity embedded hardware. Architecture, training, and deployment are co-designed around one hard constraint: **320 KB of Data RAM, no ML accelerator.**

Two ideas make it fit:

- **Quantization-Aware Distillation (QAD)** — a single-pass regime that fuses knowledge distillation from a full-precision BU-Net teacher with INT8 fake-quantization from epoch one.
- **A compile-time Rust engine** — a [fork of MicroFlow](https://github.com/federico-pizz/microflow-rs) that resolves the whole operator graph at build time: no heap allocator, no dynamic dispatch, no interpreter.

> **⚡ Want more speed?** The [`multicore`](../../tree/multicore) branch splits inference across both Xtensa cores for **~27% lower latency** (~2.35 FPS vs ~1.7 FPS) with bit-identical output. See [Branches](#branches).

## Results

### Segmentation Accuracy

| Model | Dataset | mIoU | F1 | Precision | Recall |
|:---|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| BU-Net (Teacher, Float32) | Botanic Garden | 95.2% | 95.8% | 96.9% | 94.7% |
| Nano-U (Float32) | Botanic Garden | 87.6% | 88.3% | 94.0% | 83.3% |
| **Nano-U (INT8, on ESP32)** | **Botanic Garden** | **87.6%** | **88.4%** | **94.1%** | **83.3%** |
| BU-Net (Teacher, Float32) | TinyAgri | 90.9% | 95.2% | 93.9% | 96.5% |
| Nano-U (Float32) | TinyAgri | 88.4% | 93.7% | 93.5% | 94.0% |
| **Nano-U (INT8, on ESP32)** | **TinyAgri** | **88.4%** | **93.7%** | **93.5%** | **93.9%** |

The near-zero Float32→INT8 gap (≈0 pp mIoU on both domains) shows QAD carries accuracy through quantization — the on-device INT8 model matches its Float32 source within measurement noise.

### Qualitative Results

### Training Pipeline

The QAD loop: fake-quantization nodes are injected from epoch one, so the optimizer minimizes distillation loss (teacher soft targets) and quantization error (INT8 rounding) at the same time.

## Architecture

Nano-U is a strictly sequential 7-stage encoder-decoder. Skip connections are omitted on purpose — holding encoder feature maps in SRAM until the decoder consumes them would blow the 320 KB budget. Depthwise separable convolutions (K=3) are used throughout.

| Stage | Spatial | Channels | Operation |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---|
| Encoder 1 | 60×80 → 30×40 | 3 → 4 | DW-Sep Conv × 2, MaxPool 2×2 |
| Encoder 2 | 30×40 → 15×20 | 4 → 8 | DW-Sep Conv × 2, MaxPool 2×2 |
| Encoder 3 | 15×20 → 5×10 | 8 → 16 | DW-Sep Conv × 2, MaxPool **3×2** |
| Bottleneck | 5×10 | 16 | DW-Sep Conv × 2 |
| Decoder 1 | 5×10 → 15×20 | 16 → 16 | NN Upsample 3×2, DW-Sep Conv × 2 |
| Decoder 2 | 15×20 → 30×40 | 16 → 8 | NN Upsample 2×2, DW-Sep Conv × 2 |
| Decoder 3 | 30×40 → 60×80 | 8 → 1 | NN Upsample 2×2, DW-Sep Conv × 2 |

The asymmetric 3×2 MaxPool at Stage 3 reduces 15×20 cleanly to 5×10 with no spatial misalignment. The largest intermediate tensor is 60×80×4 = 19.2 KB (INT8), keeping the arena within budget.

Parameter count is reported at three stages: the plain Float32 architecture has **4,212** weights; QAT wraps these in fake-quant nodes for a saved-checkpoint count of **4,688**; and at TFLite export the batch-norm statistics fold into the preceding convolutions, leaving **3,357** stored INT8 parameters with no accuracy loss.

SVD-based redundancy scores (`src/nas.py`) track layer utilization during training. They empirically confirm that encoder layers generalize across domains while decoder layers are domain-specific — motivating the decoder-only re-distillation strategy in [Limitations](#limitations).

### Quantization-Aware Distillation

$$\mathcal{L} = \alpha \cdot T^2 \cdot \mathcal{L}_\text{KD} + (1 - \alpha) \cdot \mathcal{L}_\text{CE}$$

where $\mathcal{L}_\text{KD}$ is MSE between temperature-scaled sigmoid outputs of teacher and student, $\mathcal{L}_\text{CE}$ is binary cross-entropy against hard labels, and $T^2$ compensates for the gradient magnitude reduction from temperature scaling.

$\alpha$ weights the **distillation** term; $(1-\alpha)$ weights the supervised term. Fake-quantization nodes are inserted before epoch 1 and gradients pass through them via the straight-through estimator, so the student learns the teacher's decision surface and a quantization-robust weight configuration in one pass. The INT8 scales and zero-points are then calibrated on real images (`quantization.calibration_split`, default `val`) and written to `<model>_quant_params.json` for `firmware/build.rs`.

### Relation to the published paper

The numbers above are **not** the ones in the [TAROS 2026 paper](#citation); the paper reports the state of the system at submission, and the repo has moved since. Both are reproducible — the difference is which config you run:

| | Paper (arXiv:2605.10210) | This repo (current) |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Config | `config/BotanicGarden_config.yaml`, `config/TinyAgri_config.yaml` | `config/*_tuned_config.yaml` |
| Distillation ($T$, $\alpha$) | BG 8.0 / 0.3 · TinyAgri 4.0 / 0.5 | BG 4.0 / 0.3 · TinyAgri 0.7 / 0.3 |
| Supervised loss | BCE only | BG: BCE · TinyAgri: 0.3·BCE + 0.7·Tversky (0.8/0.2) |
| Botanic Garden mIoU (FP32 / INT8) | 0.870 / 0.870 | 0.876 / 0.876 |
| TinyAgri mIoU (FP32 / INT8) | 0.883 / **0.700** | 0.884 / 0.884 |
| Inference latency | 845 ms (1.2 FPS) | 581 ms (~1.7 FPS), 426 ms on `multicore` |
| Peak Data RAM | 257 KB | 281 KB |
| Power | 470 mW board (137 mW idle, 333 mW active) | unchanged |

Three changes account for the gaps:

- **The TinyAgri INT8 collapse (0.883 → 0.700) is attributable to a calibration plumbing bug rather than to QAD itself.** `export_int8` did not forward `--config` to the quantizer, so INT8 calibration always read whatever `config/config.yaml` happened to contain, regardless of which config trained the model — calibrating on another domain's images, or on random noise when the paths were placeholders. Botanic Garden was unaffected because it was the domain `config/config.yaml` was filled in for. The config is now threaded through, and missing calibration images raise instead of silently degrading to noise.
- **The tuned configs** come from the leakage-safe grouped CV sweep (`scripts/cv_search.py`) run after submission; TinyAgri in particular moved to a precision-favoring Tversky blend and a sharpening $T<1$.
- **Latency and RAM** reflect the buffer-reuse work in the inference engine: faster (845 → 581 ms) at the cost of a slightly larger static arena (257 → 281 KB).

## Branches

Two deployment pipelines live in parallel branches, each paired with a matching MicroFlow branch:

| Branch | Cores | Latency | Notes |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---|
| [`main`](../../tree/main) (this one) | 1 | 581 ms (~1.7 FPS) | Simpler, lower-stack single-core baseline |
| [`multicore`](../../tree/multicore) | 2 | 426 ms (~2.35 FPS) | Splits each heavy layer across both Xtensa LX7 cores; bit-identical output |

The training/evaluation stack is identical on both — only the firmware inference path differs. See [`firmware/README.md`](firmware/README.md) for the build details.

## Datasets

Nano-U is dataset-agnostic: any binary terrain-segmentation dataset laid out as
`data/<name>/{train,val,test}/{img,mask}` works by pointing `config/config.yaml` at it.
The two below are the ones behind the results in this repo and its accompanying publication.

### Botanic Garden
An outdoor robot navigation benchmark collected in a 48,000 m² unstructured environment. We use 1,181 images from all 5 annotated sequences, split by contiguous sequence (70/20/10) to prevent temporal leakage. Binary traversability masks are derived from the original *path* class annotations.

**Original Source:** [robot-pesg/BotanicGarden](https://github.com/robot-pesg/BotanicGarden)

### TinyAgri
A custom terrain segmentation dataset captured with the onboard OV2640 camera of an ESP32-CAM mounted on a SunFounder Galaxy RVR rover. 2,659 images across two agricultural environments (tomato and corn fields), annotated with SAM 2. Released alongside this project to support future edge-robotics research.

## Installation

Requires Python 3.12 (TensorFlow has no wheels for 3.13/3.14).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/federico-pizz/Nano-U.git
cd Nano-U
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### GPU (optional)

The pinned install is CPU-only so it works everywhere; the test suite runs on CPU and GPU-marked tests skip automatically. For an NVIDIA GPU, install a CUDA-capable build:

```bash
pip install "tensorflow[and-cuda]==2.20.0"
```

> Very new GPUs (RTX 50-series / Blackwell, sm_120) aren't covered by stock TensorFlow builds yet — they need a CUDA 12.8+ toolkit and a TensorFlow nightly, typically in a separate conda environment. See NVIDIA's Blackwell compatibility guide.

For Rust firmware build and deployment, see [`firmware/README.md`](firmware/README.md).

## Usage

### Pre-trained Models

INT8 TFLite models for both domains ship in the repo under `models/`:

```
models/
├── BotanicGarden/nano_u.tflite
└── TinyAgri/nano_u.tflite
```

You can evaluate these directly without training from scratch (see [Evaluate](#evaluate)).

### Training

Fill in `config/config.yaml` with your dataset paths, then pick one of the two (mutually exclusive) options.

**Option A — QAD Pipeline (recommended).** All four phases in one shot: teacher training → student training with distillation → INT8 TFLite export → evaluation.

```bash
python scripts/run_qad.py --config config/config.yaml
```

**Option B — Standard training (no distillation).** Trains teacher and student independently.

```bash
python scripts/train_model.py bu_net --config config/config.yaml   # Teacher
python scripts/train_model.py nano_u --config config/config.yaml   # Student
```

### Evaluate

```bash
python src/evaluate.py nano_u --config config/config.yaml            # held-out test split
python src/evaluate.py nano_u --config config/config.yaml --split val --threshold 0.6
```

Reports mIoU, Dice, precision/recall and the F0.5/F1/F2 family, plus a precision–recall curve and a metric-vs-threshold sweep. When frames carry sequence ids it adds a per-sequence variance breakdown (plot + `*_report.json`). Outputs land in `results/<dataset>/<model>/`. INT8 TFLite and float Keras models go through the same forward path.

### Hyperparameter search (leakage-safe CV)

Grouped k-fold sweep over distillation temperature/alpha, augmentation regime, the CE-loss ablation, and the conservative Tversky term, with each whole capture sequence kept inside one fold. Selects by mIoU with F0.5 as the safety tiebreak.

```bash
python scripts/cv_search.py --config config/config.yaml --k 4 --epochs 200 \
    --temperatures 2 4 8 --alphas 0.3 0.5 0.7 \
    --regimes none geometric photometric full --ce on off \
    --tversky 0.0 0.5 --jobs 3
```

`--ce on off` toggles the CE term (off ≡ `alpha=1.0`); `--tversky` sweeps the precision-favoring loss `(1-w)·BCE + w·Tversky` (default `0.0` = pure BCE). `--jobs N` runs N **student** pipelines concurrently; the heavy BU-Net teacher has its own `--teacher-jobs` (default 1). `--k` must be ≤ the number of distinct sequences.

### On-Device Evaluation

```bash
python scripts/eval_esp32.py nano_u --config config/config.yaml
```

### MCU Deployment

See [`firmware/README.md`](firmware/README.md) for build setup, binary descriptions, and environment variables.

## Hardware

All experiments use an **ESP32-S3-CAM** (dual-core Xtensa LX7 @ 240 MHz, 512 KB internal SRAM, 16 MB PSRAM, OV2640 camera). No ML accelerator is present; all integer arithmetic runs on the general-purpose ALU. See [`firmware/README.md`](firmware/README.md) for build, binary descriptions, and environment variables.

---

## Limitations

- **Single-core inference (this branch).** `main` runs the operator graph on one Xtensa LX7 core, leaving the second idle. The [`multicore`](../../tree/multicore) branch spreads each heavy conv/depthwise layer across both cores for ~27% lower latency with bit-identical output; `main` stays single-core as the simpler, lower-stack baseline.
- **Fixed-domain deployment.** Nano-U is re-trained from scratch per domain. SVD redundancy scores suggest the encoder generalizes while the decoder is domain-specific, motivating decoder-only re-distillation for new domains.
