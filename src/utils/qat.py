    """Apply Quantization-Aware Training to a Keras Functional model.

    Uses `tfmot.quantization.keras.quantize_model` directly to ensure that
    layer patterns like Conv2D + BatchNormalization are correctly matched and
    folded during the fake-quantization process, which is critical for
    preserving performance.

    Args:
        model: A compiled or uncompiled Keras Functional model.
        strict: When True (the default) a wrapping failure raises. QAD depends
            on fake-quantization being present from epoch 1, so a silent
            fallback would produce a run that *looks* like QAD, trains in pure
            float, and only reveals the damage after INT8 export. Pass
            strict=False to opt into the legacy fail-soft behavior.

    Returns:
        A QAT-annotated model ready for training.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: if quantization fails and ``strict`` is True.
